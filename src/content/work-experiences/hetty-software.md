For [Eventpartners](https://eventpartners.nl/en/), I designed and built an MVP
of a multi-tenant SaaS platform for event planning & management.
Keywords: Node.js (NestJS), React, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Apollo GraphQL, codegen,
Jest, Google Cloud Run.

For [Invopop](https://www.invopop.com/) (YC W23) I built [GOBL
Builder](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.builder), a low-code editor for
reviewing and creating electronic invoice documents. Keywords: Go, WebAssembly,
Svelte, Monaco Editor, Web Workers. Additionally, I helped refactor a legacy
admin dashboard to SvelteKit, using Tailwind UI and Firestore.
