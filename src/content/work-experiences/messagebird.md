As a Tech Lead, I designed and built the (Go) backend of [Flow Builder](https://messagebird.com/applications/flow-builder), a no-code
service used +1M/month by B2C customers for automating chat, email and voice workflows.

Built developer-friendly RESTful APIs and backend services (Go, PHP) for SMS, Chat and Voice products.
