## About me

Ever since I can remember I've had a keen interest in tinkering with computers and building things with them. I've
been lucky enough to make a living doing just that for well over a decade. Aside from crafting software, I really
enjoy playing piano and guitar. I live in Amsterdam with my girlfriend and son.

## Work

I'm a **Freelance Software Engineer** with 10+ years' experience building and maintaining
web applications and services on cloud infrastructure.

I love working with teams on interesting product and engineering challenges,
approaching them with a pragmatic mindset. My area of expertise is backend web
development using **Go** and **TypeScript** (Node.js), but I also know my way
around **React** and **Svelte** on the frontend.
